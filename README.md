## Overview

### Description
Tinder but for your songs. Users will swipe on songs/artists to create a playlist. This will allow for users to find new songs in a specific genre or find new genres in general.

### Progress as of February 25, 2021
- Spotify API is connected to the app
- Once a user logs in, they are transitioned to the swiping page
- An app icon and a loading page have been created

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Music
- **Mobile:** Would mostly be used on a mobile device because we want to implement swiping as the main functionality to make your playlist. A website could be a future implementation but our focus is mobile.
- **Story:** The user will be given recommended songs and artists which they can swipe left or right on to help curate their playlists.
- **Market:** Anyone who has a spotify and is looking for a new playlist or just a way to reshuffle their own playlist.
- **Habit:** Could be used whenever they feel like looking for new music, or rediscover music they used to listen to.
- **Scope:** Initially will be just a solo user experience, however people can share their playlists to friends with similar interests, or as a way to get friends into music that you listen to.
